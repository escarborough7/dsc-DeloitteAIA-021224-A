# dsc-DeloitteAIA-021224-A 📉📊📈 - Neural Networks Intro to tensors, Keras and Tensorflow 🧠⚡️

This repository contains material describing the mathematical object tensors, what they are and how they are used in computing with neural networks. It also reviews industry standard tools like Keras and Tensorflow, which are Python libraries used to operate and run neural networks and deep learning projects. It was sourced from a gaze into the full moon reflected on the surface of a still puddle. The puddle was set on a walking path in New York City's Central Park on a crisp early spring night.
